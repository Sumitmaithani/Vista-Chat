### Vista --> https://vistachat.netlify.app/

## Inspiration
Teacher's Hack 2 is the hackathon we looking for creating some cool stuff for teacher-student bond. In lockdowns in early 2020 the risk of the virus spreading, remote working became a reality. 
It was during this period that all video calling apps really took off. As you know, most of the social and work life moved online that sparked an evolution in video sharing services like Zoom, Google Meet, and many others. 
Today, we've built a Vista app that allows you to video chat with your friends and colleagues just as well as Zoom does. With Teacher's Hack 2 theme to build strong bond between student and teacher in online classes we built Vista app.

## What it does
Vista is a online video sharing app that can used to chat with your friends, colleagues and anyone you want without any signup-signin thing instantly from your desktop, pc or phone.  

## How we built it
Vista frontend is built using react and the backend is built using nodejs, express and socket.io.  

## Challenges we ran into
Okay, so this is my first time in working with socket.io which is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server. Which i found little challenging for the first time.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For the first time we used Socket.io, which was a new tech for all of us still we achieved it using the documentation and by doing mistakes.

## What we learned
We learnt Socket.io along the way
We learnt realtime communication and concept of websockets.


## What's next for Vista
Next we will add many features including multi user call, screen sharing, live chat, create room calls... etc.
